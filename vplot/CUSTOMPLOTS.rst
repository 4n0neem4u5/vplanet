Custom Plots
------------

If you run ``vplot`` on the example in ``examples/gl581`` with the default configuration, 
you get a rather nasty-looking plot:

.. image:: img/gl581_ugly.png?raw=True
   :alt: example
   :align: center

You can change the number of columns and the size of the figure in ``vplot_config.py``,
but sometimes you want a little more control over the layout and appearance of the plot.
