***** INSTALL *****

This file provides a description of how to install the software necessary to
simulate the examples in this repository.

1. Ensure you have installed the following:
    A. A C compiler, e.g. gcc, clang, etc.
    B. Python 3.x [Note that this version should be the python in your PATH]
        N.B. We recommend installing python via anaconda
    C. matplotlib v1.4.0 or higher

2. Clone the repository from GitHub:
      > git clone https://github.com/VirtualPlanetaryLaboratory/vplanet.git
   Compile the code:
      > make opt

3. At this point you should be able to run the code on one of the examples. To
   verify it's working, execute the following commands:
   > cd examples/EarthInterior
   > vplanet vpl.in

   This should create files called earth.earth.forward earth.log that contain
   results from the simulation that you can check. This example recreates the
   thermal and magnetic evolution of Earth and should require about 1 second.

4. VPLanet has its own plotting package which can streamline your research. This
   package is not required, but you can only reproduce the plots in this
   repository exactly if you install it. There are two ways to install it, via
   pip, or cloning from GitHub:
   > pip install vplot
   OR
   > git clone https://github.com/VirtualPlanetaryLaboratory/vplot.git
   > cd vplot
   > python setup.py install --user
   We recommend installing as administrator, which can be completed by changing
      the last command to
   > sudo python setup.py develop

5. If you encountered no errors, then everything should be setup. To quickly
    determine if it worked, execute the following from the vplanet directory:

    > cd examples/EarthInterior
    > vplanet vpl.in
    > python makeplot.py png

    These commands require less than 1 minute and should create 2 png figures
      identical to those in the examples/EarthInterior directory.

6. If you did encounter errors, it is probably because either a) vplanet is not
    in your PATH, b) the proper version of python is not in your PATH, c) you do
    not have the proper version of python installed, or d) you need to update
    matplotlib. If you have followed these instructions exactly and still cannot
    generate the EarthInterior png files, please contact Rory Barnes at
    rory@astro.washington.edu.
