***** INSTALL *****

This file provides a description of how to install the software necessary to
simulate the examples in this repository.

1. Ensure you have installed the following:
    A. A C compiler, e.g. gcc, clang, etc.
    B. Python 3.x [Note that this version should be the python in your PATH]
        N.B. We recommend installing python via anaconda
    C. matplotlib v1.4.0 or higher

2. Clone the repository from GitHub.
    Compile the code: > make opt

3. Pip install or clone vplot.
    > pip install vplot
    OR
    > git clone https://github.com/VirtualPlanetaryLaboratory/vplot.git
    > cd vplot
    > python setup.py develop
    We recommend installing as administrator, but it does work for regular users
      by changing the last command to
    > python setup.py install --user

4. If you encountered no errors, then everything should be setup. To quickly
    determine if it worked, execute the following from the vplanet directory:

    > cd examples/EarthInterior
    > vplanet vpl.in
    > python makeplot.py png

    These commands require less than 1 minute and should create 2 png figures
      identical to those in the examples/EarthInterior directory.

5. If you did encounter errors, it is probably because either a) vplanet is not
    in your PATH, b) the proper version of python is not in your PATH, c) you do
    not have the proper version of python installed, or d) you need to update
    matplotlib. If you have followed these instructions exactly and still cannot
    generate the EarthInterior png files, please contact Rory Barnes at
    rory@astro.washington.edu.
