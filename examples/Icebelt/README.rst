This example validates **VPLanet**'s 1-D climate model through reproducing the
results of Figure 2 of the `(Rose et. al 2017) <https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aa8306/meta#apjaa8306s2>`_.

The climate evolution of an Earth-like planet at 1.02 AU with an obliquity of 
55 degrees, and an eccentricity of 0. The surface temperature (top) shows that
over the course of the simulation, the equator is colder than the poles, thus
ice formation occurs. The annual average insolation (2nd panel) shows the amount
of solar radiation reaching the surface, and over the course of the simulation,
the area where the Ice belt forms received *less* solar radiation than the poles. 
Albedo (3rd panel) shows the reflectiveness of the planetâ€™s surface, and ice is 
more reflective than water. Ice sheet height (4th panel), shows that as the 
simulation of the planet occurs, the ice sheet grows in height to approx 200m. 
The bedrock height (5th panel), shows that as the ice sheet grows in height, it 
compresses the bedrock downward.

This figure shows the seasonal evolution of Earth over the course of a single year.
Insolation (Panel 1), shows that over the course of the season, the planet receives
sunlight on the poles and the equator, but not enough to fully melt the ice belts
before winter occurs. Panel 2 shows the overall surface temperature over the course
of the orbit. The ice balance (panel 3) shows the overall growth of the ice over the 
season, meaning there is more ice along the equator than the poles.
