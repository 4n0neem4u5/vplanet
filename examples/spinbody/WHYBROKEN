- Make each example a top-level directory in `examples/` with a descriptive name
  *or*, if they are all part of a simulation ensemble, create a Python script that
  runs and plots the results.
- Please add a README.rst to each one (copy convention from other examples)
- Clean up input files:
    - Align the options
    - Add comments explaining all options
    - Remove commented lines / disabled inputs
