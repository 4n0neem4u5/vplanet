Short description
-----------------

A test of angular momentum conservation for a contracting star.
As the star contracts onto the main sequence, the rotation period
should decrease to conserve angular momentum. This example shows that
this is in fact working in VPLANET.

To run this example
-------------------

```
vplanet vpl.in
vplot
```
