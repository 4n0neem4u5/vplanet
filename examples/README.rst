VPLANET Examples
================

This subdirectory contains examples of numerous ways to use `vplanet`. A brief
description of each is provided below, arranged by topic (with modules listed in brackets). Click on the directory above to see scripts,
plots, and more description of the physics.

**ATMOSPHERES**
===============

`AtmEscKepler-36 <https://github.com/VirtualPlanetaryLaboratory/vplanet/tree/master/examples/AtMescKepler-36>`_: The loss of a hydrogen envelope due to stellar XUV flux.

**BinaryTides**: Coupled stellar and tidal evolution of short-period binary stars.

**CassiniStates**: Decay of a body's obliquity to a constant value due to perturbations
from other bodies and tidal damping.

**Corot-7**: Evolution of a tidally-damped two-planet system into a state in which
the major axes circulate with the same frequency.

**EarthInterior**: Evolution of Earth's thermal and magnetic properties (plate tectonics).

**EarthMoonTides**: Evolution of the Earth-Moon system due to equilibrium tides.

**GalHabit**: Evolution of a wide binary's orbit due to radial migration in the galaxy
and perturbations from passing stars.

**IoHeat**: Tidal heating of Io.

**Kepler-16**: Orbital evolution of a circumbinary planet.

**MagneticBraking**: Rotational evolution of stars under different magnetic braking
assumptions.

**MainSequence**: Pre-main sequence and main sequence evolution of stellar properties.

**Milankovitch**: Earth's climate through one year, as well as ice sheet growth and
retreat on long timescales due to orbital and rotational forcings.

**O2BuildUp**: Production of abiotic oxygen on terrestrial worlds due to water
photolyzation and hydrogen escape.

**RadHeat**: Radiogenic heating evolution in Earth's core, mantle and crust.

**SpiNBody**: N-body integration of the Solar System.

**SSDistOrbDistRot**: Evolution of the Solar System planets' orbital and rotational
angular momenta from approximate models.

**VenusInterior**: Thermal and magnetic evolution of Venus' interior (stagnant lid).

**VenusWaterLoss**: Water loss from Venus due to the Sun's XUV flux.
