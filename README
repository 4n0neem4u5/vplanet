This repository contains the source files and an example case for the code
VPLANET. To compile:

gcc -o vplanet *.c -lm

(Makefile to come later.) The example directory considers the tidal evolution
of Gl 581 d. To run the code:

vplanet vpl.in

You can also access the onboard help with the command: 

vplanet -h

Have fun!
