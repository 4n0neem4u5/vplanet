This repository contains the source files and an example case for the code
VPLANET. To compile:

gcc -o vplanet *.c -lm

This is version 0.1, which includes the EQTIDE and RADHEAT modules. Also included is 
an example directory which demonstrates how to use the code, and the .in files provide
helpful tips in lieu of actual documentation. The system is something like Gl 581 ca. mid-2010.

To run the code:

vplanet vpl.in

You can also access the onboard help with the command: 

vplanet -h

Have fun!
